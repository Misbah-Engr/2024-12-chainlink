    "terms": ["Liquidity Provider"],
    "definition": "A participant who deposits assets into decentralized exchange liquidity pools, providing tradable assets and earning a share of trading fees. Liquidity providers typically receive tokens representing their contribution, which can be redeemed to reclaim their share of the pool plus accrued fees. They play a crucial role in maintaining pool liquidity and price stability, but may face risks such as impermanent loss during significant price movements.\nKey aspects:\n- Deposit pairs of assets, often in equal value\n- Earn fees proportional to their pool share\n- May be subject to impermanent loss\n- Can add or remove liquidity using specific functions\n- Essential for the functioning of many decentralized exchanges\nRelevant concepts in code might include functions for modifying liquidity, managing pool keys, and handling liquidity parameters."
  },
  {
    "terms": ["Volatility"],
    "definition": "The degree of price fluctuation for assets in a market over time. High volatility increases the risk of losses for investors and traders, as rapid price changes can lead to significant differences between expected and actual asset values. Volatility also impacts the effectiveness of various price averaging mechanisms, with longer averaging periods generally providing more stable price indicators in volatile markets."
  },
  {
    "terms": ["Arbitrage"],
    "definition": "Arbitrage refers to the practice of exploiting price differences between different markets to generate risk-free profits. It typically involves buying assets in one market where they are priced lower and simultaneously selling them in another market where they are priced higher. This mechanism helps align prices across different markets and maintains price equilibrium. For example, if 1 unit of Asset A costs 200 units of Asset B in Market X but can be sold for 220 units of Asset B in Market Y, an arbitrageur can profit 20 units of Asset B (minus fees) through this process. Arbitrage is crucial for price discovery and overall market efficiency across various financial systems."

  {
    "terms": ["Slippage"],
    "definition": "Slippage in decentralized exchanges refers to the difference between the expected price of a trade and the actual execution price. It occurs due to market fluctuations while a transaction is pending on the blockchain. To protect users, exchanges often implement slippage tolerances - user-defined maximum acceptable deviations from the expected price. If the actual price exceeds this tolerance, the transaction fails. Slippage calculations are crucial for constructing safe trades, especially in volatile markets or for large orders that may significantly impact the pool's liquidity."
  },
  {
    "terms": ["Spread"],
    "definition": "In the context of decentralized exchanges, \"Spread\" refers to the distribution of large orders over time through mechanisms like Time-Weighted Average Market Makers (TWAMM).

Hedging aims to protect liquidity providers against adverse price movements while optimizing returns from trading fees."
  },
  {
    "terms": ["Swap"],
    "definition": "A fundamental operation in decentralized exchanges where one token is exchanged for another within a liquidity pool. The swap function typically iterates through price levels, calculating token amounts at each step until the specified amount is fully exchanged or a price limit is reached. It uses parameters like swap direction, input or output amount, and price boundaries. Swaps are executed against pooled liquidity rather than an order book, with built-in safety checks to protect users from adverse price impacts and slippage. Swaps often emit events recording details such as amounts exchanged, new prices, liquidity, and other relevant data."
  },
  {
    "terms": ["Futures"],
    "definition": "In the context of decentralized exchanges, \"Futures\" are typically not explicitly implemented in the core protocol. Most decentralized exchanges focus on spot trading and liquidity provision for cryptocurrencies and tokens. The protocols do not natively support futures contracts, which are agreements to buy or sell assets at a predetermined price at a specified time in the future. Instead, some decentralized exchanges introduce customizable features and flexible pool configurations that allow for more advanced trading strategies within the decentralized exchange framework."

  {
    "terms": ["Concentrated Liquidity"],
    "definition": "Concentrated liquidity is a feature in advanced automated market makers (AMMs) that allows liquidity providers to allocate their assets within specific price ranges, rather than across the entire price spectrum. This mechanism enhances capital efficiency by enabling liquidity to be concentrated where it's most needed, typically around the current market price. Liquidity providers can create custom positions with upper and lower price bounds, often represented by \"ticks\" in the protocol. When the market price is within a position's range, that liquidity is active and earns trading fees. If the price moves outside the range, the liquidity becomes inactive until the price returns. This system allows for more efficient market making, potentially higher returns for liquidity providers, and better pricing for traders, especially in stable or range-bound markets. Concentrated liquidity was pioneered by Uniswap V3 and has since been adopted or adapted by other decentralized exchange protocols."

    "definition": "\nERC1271 is a standard interface for smart contracts to validate signatures. It enables contracts to implement custom signature verification logic, extending signature capabilities beyond Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs). The standard defines an `isValidSignature` function that takes a message hash and a signature, returning a specific magic value (`0x1626ba7e`) if the signature is valid. This allows for complex signature schemes like multi-sig wallets, smart contract wallets, and delegated signing. ERC1271 is crucial for account abstraction, decentralized exchanges with off-chain orders, and Sign-In With Ethereum (SIWE) implementations.\n\nKey implementation:\n\n```solidity\ncontracts/lib/v4-core/lib/openzeppelin-contracts/contracts/interfaces/IERC1271.sol\n\ninterface IERC1271 {\n    function isValidSignature(bytes32 hash, bytes memory signature) external view returns (bytes4 magicValue);\n}\n```\n\nThis interface is the core of ERC1271, defining the standard method that compliant contracts must implement to support custom signature validation."

    "definition": "\nA method in blockchain technology that allows individual applications to define and control the ordering of their own transactions, rather than relying on the default sequencing rules of the underlying blockchain protocol. ASS enables applications to optimize transaction ordering for their specific needs, potentially reducing the impact of miner extractable value (MEV) and improving efficiency and fairness for users. This approach is particularly relevant for decentralized exchanges (DEXes) and other DeFi applications where transaction sequencing can significantly affect user outcomes."

    "definition": "\nMEV, or Maximal Extractable Value, refers to the maximum profit that can be extracted from blockchain networks by reordering, inserting, or censoring transactions within blocks. In the context of Angstrom, MEV mitigation is a core feature aimed at protecting both users and liquidity providers (LPs) from potential exploitation. The project implements mechanisms such as batch processing of limit orders at uniform prices and a \"Top of Block (ToB) Auction\" to redistribute value that would otherwise be extracted by arbitrageurs. These strategies help ensure fair trade execution, limit censorship, and minimize value leakage from the underlying Automated Market Maker (AMM), ultimately creating a more equitable and efficient decentralized exchange ecosystem.\n\n\ncontracts/docs/overview.md\n\n- **Mitigates MEV:**\n    - **For Users:** The network has mechanisms to limit censorship and clears all limit orders in\n    batches at a common uniform price, guaranteeing that all users are treated _fairly_ and cannot\n    easily be extracted from via e.g. sandwich attacks.\n    - **For LPs:** The competition to extract MEV from the underlying AMM is internalized in the\n    form of a \"ToB (Top of Block) Auction\" in which the proceeds are redistributed to the LPs to\n    limit the value leakage from the being AMM being arbitraged.\n"

An optional Automated Market Maker (AMM) snapshot\n\nThe `OrderBook` is typically constructed using a `BookBuilder` pattern and employs a `SortStrategy` to keep orders organized, usually by price and then by volume or time.

ToB orders are structured to include asset quantities, gas limits, and validity constraints tied to specific block numbers. They are prioritized for execution before other transactions in a block, potentially offering advantages in high-frequency or time-sensitive trading scenarios. ToB orders are typically processed through a dedicated mechanism that validates and executes them as part of the block creation process, ensuring they receive preferential treatment in transaction ordering.\n\nKey components of ToB orders, as seen in `contracts/src/types/ToBOrderBuffer.sol`, include:\n- Quantity specifications for input and output assets\n- Gas usage limits\n- Asset addresses involved in the swap\n- Block number validity\n- Recipient information\n\nThis order type is crucial for traders seeking to capitalize on market inefficiencies or execute trades with minimal slippage by ensuring their orders are processed at the earliest possible moment within a new block."
